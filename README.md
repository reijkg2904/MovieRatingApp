# MovieRatingApp

## A movie rating app created in Java

This project has a list of five movies. The user is prompted with three options:
1. View the list of movies
2. Select and rate a movie
3. Exit

The second option asks a user to choose a movie from the list, then asks them to rate that movie.
Once it has been rated, the list is updated with the new rating and the number of people that rated it.
